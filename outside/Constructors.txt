Constructor:
1. What is constructor?
It is a special method in java which is used to initialize the object.
(i.e if class level variables non static varaibles is not 
initialize then constructor will initialize to default values)

2. How many types constructors?
   there are two types of constructors
   1. default constructor(Compiler will add default constructor,which is invoked by JVM(at runtime) when there is no  
user defined constructor)
   2. user defined constructor
      a. without parameters
      b. with parameters
3. Rules for writing constructors?
   1. constructor name is same as class name
   2. it should not have return type
   3. access specifier is optional
4.can constructor can be overloaded or not?
  yes constructor can be overloaded
5. Constructor overloading defination?
   in one class if we found more than one constructor with different 
parameters list  known as constructor overloading.
6. diffrence between constructor and methods?
Methods:

1. method name is user defined
2. methods are of 4 types
3. method will have return type 
4. method is called by using objectname or classname 
(explictly we have to call the method)

Constructors:
1. constructor name is same as class name
2. constructors are of two types
3. constructors will not have return type 
4. constructor invoke automatically (implicitly)at 
the time of object creation no need to call with class name or 
                                                             object name
7. Can constructor have Access specifier?
yes
if constructor is public we can create object anywhere in Project.
if constructor is protected we can create Object anywhere inside same package.
if constructor is private we can create object only in same class. 

8. Can Constructor ovverriding is possible?
No
